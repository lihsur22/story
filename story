One day, BRR was in the woods, scouring for fruits to bring to her beloved grandmother. On the way she met a wolf. The wolf told BRR to give her fruits to it but she refused as she picked them for her grandmother. She scared the wolf away by throwing some rocks at it and went on her way to grandmother's house. The wolf followed her. By the time she could reach her house, the wolf already reached it. The wolf locked the grandmother in the closet and dressed up as the grandmother. When BRR came into the house she saw a suspicious "grandmother" laying on the bed, sick. The wolf asked BRR to come closer and asked BRR to open its mouth. The wolf kept prompting BRR to get closer to its mouth. By the time the wolf was about to chomp off BRR, BRR heard a cry from the closet. She rushed to the closet to unlock it and saw her grandmother. The grandmother told BRR what happened and she threw the fruits at the wolf so as to shoo the wolf away. She succeeded and she and her grandmother ate the fruits. They got an entertaining story out of it at least.
